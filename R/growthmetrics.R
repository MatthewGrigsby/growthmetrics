#' growthmetrics
#'
#'  Metrics for comparing both nested and non-nested growth models.
#'  Each metric is a transformation of the mean squared error (MSE).
#'  The normalized MSE (nMSE) is normalized to location of growth measure,
#'  age-adjusted MSE (aMSE) calculates subject-specic MSE estimates by age
#'  groups, and the weighted MSE (wMSE) calculates subject specific estimates
#'  that are weighted by a variable of particular interest.
