\title{DPFFR using pffr}
\usage{
dpffr_pffr(data = HAZ, time = 0:15, hist.lngth = 7)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A matrix of values with each row representing an individual and each column representing measurements at each time point (e.g. column 1 is time point 1, etc.). Measurements are assumed to be taken at the same time intervals for every participant.}

\item{time}{A vector of times. This equal the number of columts in the matrix provided (e.g. 0 through 15 months for the example dataset).}

\item{hist.lngth}{The length of known history for the observed process. We use leave one-curve out cross validation for prediction (hist.lgth is 7 for the example dataset).}
}
\value{
A matrix of predictions with rows representing each individual and columts representing predictions for each time point.
}
\description{
DPFFR considers a functional response Y[i,(t*+1):length(month)] for each subject i. The predictor,
Y[i,1:t*], is also functional, which makes the approach a dynamic function-on-function regression. We
provide the implementation of DPFFR with the pffr function from the refund R package and the gam function
from the mgcv R package.
}
\details{
When using pffr from the refund R package, the user directly refers to the functional response
Y[i,(t*+1):length(month)] and functional predictor Y[i,1:t*]. The response and predictor data are
stored as matrices.
