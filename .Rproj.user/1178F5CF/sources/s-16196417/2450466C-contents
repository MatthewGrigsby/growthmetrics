Description: Metrics for comparing both nested and non-nested growth models. Each metric is a transformation of the mean squared error (MSE). The normalized MSE (nMSE) is normalized to location of growth measure (i.e. by age), age-adjusted MSE (aMSE) calculates subject-specic MSE estimates by age groups, and the weighted MSE (wMSE) calculates subject specific estimates that are weighted by a variable of particular interest.
